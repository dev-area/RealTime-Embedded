This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation

MCB2100:   Keil MCB2100 evaluation board with ULINK debugger
           - Application is loaded to internal Flash.
